Practical Information:

Each song has a full arrangement and 4-5 loops. The full loop includes all the instruments, while loop1-4 have the instruments divided up. That way you can program the game engine to have them playing simultaneously at no volume and fade them in or out when something changes in-game for a more interesting and game driven arrangement.

Hope you enjoy and feel free to contact me for any questions and thoughts! :)
